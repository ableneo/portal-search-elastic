	  <description>Regular expression naming plugin directory names to
	  include.  Any plugin not matching this expression is excluded.
	  In any case you need at least include the nutch-extensionpoints plugin. By
	  default Nutch includes crawling just HTML and plain text via HTTP,
	  and basic indexing and search plugins. In order to use HTTPS please enable 
	  protocol-httpclient, but be aware of possible intermittent problems with the 
	  underlying commons-httpclient library. Set parsefilter-naivebayes for classification based focused crawler.
